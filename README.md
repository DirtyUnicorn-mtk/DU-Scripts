# To use the Nico-Build-Script

git clone this repo
https://github.com/DirtyUnicorns/DU-Scripts.git

Open up a terminal in a directory where you want to download it and copy/paste this

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DirtyUnicorns/DU-Scripts.git
```

Now with your file browser go into the DU-Scripts folder and copy the build_DU.sh file and paste it in your DU root source.

After doing that, you are ready to use the script simply by this way :

Open up a terminal or if you have the old terminal still open, in your DU root source and type this ```. build_DU.sh```

After, simply respond to what is displayed to compile the build.


# To use the nathan-build-script

 In the root of your DU source, type `bash nathan-build-script.sh --help` to learn about the script.
